## StoX Readme

Stox is built on Next.JS V15 so you'll need nodejs version 20 or later installed to run the application

You will also need our .env file which contains API keys and the database url , this should already be included in the zip file

To start the application, start with a basic `npm install` and then `npm run dev`
